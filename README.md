STEMHacks' own hour of code module for Downingtown STEM Academy

Often times people will think that programming is only something you need to learn if you want to be a programmer. But that could not be farther from the truth

Programming is a skill that can be applied to hundreds of different subjects. Today we are going to explore some examples of these
and see how coding can relate to you. Below are different links separated by category that show off what coding can do and how 
it could help you explore your interests. 

Our recommendation is that you open the different links in new tabs by right-clicking or double clicking on the link and then clicking "open in new tab"

## Mathematics



<a href="https://octave-online.net/" target="_blank">Octave</a> is an incredible tool for mathematics. It lets users do complex calculations and make complicated graphs that you couldn't make anywhere else. 

Here is some sample code you can copy and paste into octave to show you what it can do.

```
[x,y]=meshgrid(-0.5:0.1:0.5);
z=sin(x)+cos(y);
surf(z)
```

[D3 Graphs](https://d3js.org/) is a programming tool that can help you make almost any type of graph you can image. On the website there are literally hundreds of grpahs that you can look at and learn to make.


[Seeing Theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/ ) - This is a website that shows some incredible visualizations of complicated math concepts. So if a concept in math is making you struggle this could clear it up. 


## Art

[Google Art gallery or projects made with code](https://devart.withgoogle.com/) - Google once held an event where they asked as many developers as they could to make some art by using technology. Here is the full gallery of projects; each project has a detailed description and explanation of how it was built. 

[Make your own art with code](http://devartcodefactory.com/#/home) - This is a project that shows you how to make different 3d art step by step in code. 

[Animations with Code](http://animejs.com/) - Examples of some of the fluidity of animating using code. 

[3D Art with Code](https://threejs.org/) - Lots of different examples of 3d art made with the same code that makes websites.
